# hello-world
First GitHub project!

Hello everyone! I am currently a student at a university, and I'm a computer science major. Switching from laptops to the school desktops are hard work, so I felt like making a GitHub account to make my life somewhat easier. 

Right now I'm leaning Java, but I'm really interested in any other OOP languages, mostly Python right now!
